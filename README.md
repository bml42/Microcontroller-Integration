# Microcontroller-Integration
Integration of C and C# programs for use with an Arduino Mega 2560 Rev 3 microcontroller.
<br></br>These projects allow for communication between the user who would be entering and receiving data from the microcontroller via the C# programs.  Having access to a form with adjustable textboxes and buttons makes it easy for a user to understand and control what the Arduino Mega does.  Mostly, the Arduino is used for taking measurements like temperature or distance, or controlling current flow to devices like LEDs or motor drivers.
